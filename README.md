# DRL-based Network Path Selection For Multimedia Traffic in SDNs #

This repository fullfils its supporting role to a master thesis on "Intelligent Routing for Software-Defined Media Networks". It explores two ways to optimize routing in the transport of multimedia content in SDNs. This project in delevoped in Python and relies on three main Python packages: OpenAI Gym, PyTorch and NetworkX.

These approaches at routing optimization explored in this project are divided into two folders:
  - link_cost_routing_optimization,
  - drl_routing_optimization.
